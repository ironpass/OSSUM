3.1 Palm OS provides no means of concurrent processing. Discuss three major complications that concurrent processing adds to an operating system
	- The operating system needs to keep a track of memory space allocated to the processes and limits the accessible memory of that process
	- Process shifting to hard disk creates overhead on operating system
	- Time sharing requires preemption of processes that do not give up CPU and the kernel on their own
3.2 Describe the differences among the short-term, medium-term, and long-term scheduling
	- Short-term (CPU schduler): selects a process from those that are in memory and ready to execute, and and allocates the CPU to it
	- Medium-term (memory manager): selects processes from the ready or blocked queue and removes them from memory, then reinstates them later to continue running
	- Long-term (job scheduler): determines which jobs are brought into the system for processing
3.3 Describe the actions taken by a kernel to switch context
	a. Among threads
	b. Among processes
	- a) The thread context must be saved (registers) and another thread's context must be loaded
	- b) The same as (a), plus the memory context must be stored and that of the next process must be loaded
3.4 What are the benefits and the disadvantages of each of the following? Consider both the system level and the programmer level. 
	a) Synchronous and asynchronous communication
		Benefit: Rendezvous between sender and receiver
		Disadvantage: Blocking sends do not require rendezvous
	b) Automatic and explicit buffering
		Benefit: Automatic buffering provides indefinite length, thus sender will never be blocked
		Disadvantage: But it will waste a lot of memory
	c) Send by copy and send by reference
		Benefit:  Send by reference allows the programmer to write a distributed version of a centralized application
		Disadvantage: Passing a parameter by reference requires declaring the parameter as a remote object
	d) Fixed-sized and variable-sized messages
		Benefit: Variable-sized messages can be flexible
		Disadvantage: Variable-sized messages use shared memory to pass the message
